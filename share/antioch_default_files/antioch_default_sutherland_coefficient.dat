# Coefficients for Sutherland viscosity model
# 
# Form of the fit:
# 
# mu = A*T^1.5/(T + B)
# 
# where T is in Kelvin and the viscosity is then given in Pa-s.

# CPAir & CPN2 -- compatibility with benkirk's dissertation cases
# 
# Sutherland coefficients are in general not as accurate as Blottner fits,
# and are provided mainly for completeness.
